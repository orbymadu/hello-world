#Hello-World
#About Me: 

This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow
Trying to build myself using the inspiration and knowledge the world presents to me through It's maker.
Truly grateful for my person, my hubby. His kindness, patience, love and knowledge are truly unmatched. 
I'm trying to learn to use GitHub. So far, it's going alright. 
Been able to create a repo, make a branch and about to save a commit (saved changes). I'm gonna get the hang of it all, fingers crossed.
